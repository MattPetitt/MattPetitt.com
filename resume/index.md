#### Profile
I am a full time developer based in Reston VA. I specialize in responsive, dynamic, and highly interactive front-end web experiences. For the last 5 years I have helped startups in the DC area rapidly launch and maintain their initial web presence. I also have extensive experience with analytics, SEO, A/B testing, and digital marketing.

#### Senior Front-end Developer

As the owner of the web-development portion of our project, I was able to take us from no web product to initial launch in under a year. I built a canvas-based WYSIWYG ID card designer from scratch using Typscript, Fabric.js, Angular, Bootstrap, Kendo, and Webpack. I also built an ID card template and printer management portal using Java, Tapestry, Kendo, and Bootstrap.

I worked with our digital marketing firm to optimize our marketing funnel by setting up analytics, tag-management, SEO, and A/B testing. I built and managed 4 different SPA applications built in Angular, React, Redux, Bootstrap, and SASS. A marketing site, video on demand streaming application, a media CMS dashboard, a live streaming site, and a Wordpress blog.
