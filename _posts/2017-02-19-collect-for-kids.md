### Project
A Wordpress site with custom theming and plugins.

### Case-Study-ish
This was a really cool volunteer project Innolance did for a local program with FCPS called Collect for Kids. The website served as a CMS managed hub for information on backpack and supplies drives, as well as featuring the programs sponsors.

### Does it still exist?
Unfortunately not ðŸ˜¢
