### Project
My Website

### Case-Study-ish
This is a statically generated Jekyll website with a theme I customized based on [the Casper theme for Ghost CMS](https://demo.ghost.io/){:target="_blank"}. The last version of this was a Wordpress site, but performance and maintenance wise a hosted CMS was overkill. I've redesigned this website so many times, so hopefully this one will last for a while.

### Does it still exist?
*Insert recursion joke here.*
