Absolutely not. Does that mean I shouldn’t have one? Probably. But I’m going to do it anyway, and here’s why.

### It’s not for the world, it’s for me.

I haven’t written anything more complex than an email since High School, and I really need to change that. There is nothing I enjoy more than when I stumble across a piece of writing that is inspiringly eloquent. And like many people, when I see a brilliantly creative work, I’m inspired to emulate it. But like any other skill, writing takes practice, so this is my outlet.

### But I guess it’s kind of for the world…

It seems like every developer these days has a blog, but that doesn’t make them any less impressive. Just getting this far through my first blog post has given me an appreciation for the effort that is required to make an intelligible post. I guess this blog will let me take what I spend so much time researching, and turn that into some sort of tangible output. So in short, I want to impress people.

### It Forces me to keep learning

So far, the main gist of what I will be doing here is checking out resources in the Javascript community. I will be tackling Style Guides, Ebooks, Frameworks, Libraries, and anything else intriguing that I come across. I plan to study them front to back, and even utilize them in my work. After I feel comfortable with the material, this will be my outlet for a post-mortem review. Hopefully this really forces me to go in depth into the material.

### What my plans are

So far I have a solid list of things I plan to check out, some I have used before, others I have never even heard of.

- [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- [You don’t know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
- [JS Must Watch](https://github.com/bolshchikov/js-must-watch)
- [Idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js)
- [Javascript Patterns](https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns)
- [Mostly adequate guide to functional programming](https://github.com/DrBoolean/mostly-adequate-guide)
- [Javascript in one pic](https://github.com/coodict/javascript-in-one-pic)
- [Mozilla JS Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction)
- [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [Writing Modular JS](http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/)

I have a strong feeling this list will grow much faster than I will be able to check them off.
