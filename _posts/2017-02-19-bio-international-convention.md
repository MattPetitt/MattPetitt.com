### Project
An Ektron CMS website using a custom modified Bootstrap 3 based UI.

### Case-Study-ish
So this website was actually a pretty interesting project in terms of creative-time-saving. The previous design of the website included a massive amount of fairly complex templates, so while the client wanted a re-design we realized redoing all of the templates would be a big undertaking. What we ended up doing was redesigning the site off of the previous classes and DOM with new styles, overwriting the previous styles section by section. Pretty hacky in retrospect, but it's still live old messy jQuery and all so what do I know.

### Does it still exist?
[Yup, check it out here.](http://convention.bio.org/){:target="_blank"}
