### Project
A SVOD Web Application

### Case-Study-ish
A React/Redux application for browsing and streaming shows and movies to desktop and mobile browsers. Initially I built out the initial app from scratch in 6 months with Angular, Bootstrap, and Grunt, we eventually rebuilt it with React, Redux, and Webpack. The rewrite allowed us to modular styling and templates to share most of the code between our web and smart TV app.

Marketing Site

### Case-Study-ish
An Angular app that serves as the main marketing site and onboarding flow. Heavily optimized for speed and performance to decrease bounce rates. Integrated with Google Analytics and Tag Manager for marketing analytics, and Optimizely for A/B testing.

### Project
Admin Dashboard

### Case-Study-ish
An custom Angular CMS for managing the content library. Not much secret sauce here, just a lot of CRUD's.

### Does it still exist?
Not for public consumption.
