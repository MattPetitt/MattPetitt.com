### Project
Website for the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown

### Case-Study-ish
An Episerver CMS website using a custom modified Bootstrap 3 based UI. This had to be responsive and cross-browser compatible back when that was still super hard and not very automated.

### Does it still exist?
[Yup, check it out here.](http://www.upj.pitt.edu/){:target="_blank"}
