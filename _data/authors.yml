  description: I am a full time developer based in Reston VA. I specialize in responsive,
               dynamic, and highly interactive Front-End web experiences. For the last 6 years
               I have helped startups in the DC area rapidly launch and maintain their initial web
               presence. I also have extensive experience with analytics, SEO, A/B testing, and
               digital marketing.
